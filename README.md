Do you feel overwhelmed when you order a bottle of wine at the restaurant or buy from supermarket or wine store? 
Wine selection is complicated and personal. The one you love doesnâ€™t necessarily depend on the rating or price. It depends on your personal taste.
What if you can have a virtual personal sommelier who can recommend the right wine based on your taste or the wine you already tried?
Just like how the sommelier would recommend wine for you. This project aims to classify wine variety and identify similar wine based on taste by analyzing the descriptors written by sommeliers.
